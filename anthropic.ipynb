It was introduced by the British philosopher Bertrand Russell in the early 20th century to illustrate the problems that can arise from self-reference in logical statements.\\n\\nThe paradox is as follows:\\nIn a town, there is only one barber. The barber is a man who shaves all and only those men in the town who do not shave themselves. The question is, does the barber shave himself?\\n\\nThe paradox arises when we try to answer this question:\\n1. If the barber shaves himself, then he is not one of the men in the town who do not shave themselves. Therefore, he should not be shaved by the barber (which is himself), leading to a contradiction.\\n\\n2. If the barber does not shave himself, then he is one of the men in the town who do not shave themselves. Therefore, he should be shaved by the barber (which is himself), again leading to a contradiction.\\n\\nThe self-referential nature of the statement \"the barber shaves all and only those men who do not shave themselves\" is the root cause of the paradox. The barber\\'s job description refers to the set of men who do not shave themselves, but the barber himself must either belong to this set or not, which creates a logical inconsistency.\\n\\nThis paradox is related to Russell\\'s Paradox, which deals with the set of all sets that do not contain themselves as members. Both paradoxes highlight the problems that can occur when a statement or a set is defined in terms of itself, leading to self-reference and potential logical contradictions.\\n\\nThe Barber Paradox and similar self-referential paradoxes have had significant implications in the development of logic, set theory, and the foundations of mathematics. They have led to the development of more rigorous and precise formulations of logical and mathematical concepts to avoid the pitfalls of self-reference and maintain consistency in these systems.'\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# streamlit app with claude 3\n","import streamlit as st\n","from langchain_anthropic import ChatAnthropic\n","\n","st.title(\"Anthropic - Claude 3 Opus testing\")\n","\n","# Input for Anthropic API Key\n","anthropic_api_key = st.sidebar.text_input('Enter Anthropic API Key', type='password')\n","\n","# Function to generate response\n","def generate_response(input_text):\n","    if not anthropic_api_key.startswith('sk-ant-'):\n","        st.warning('Please enter a valid Anthropic API key')\n","    elif not input_text:\n","        st.warning('Please enter some text')\n","    else:\n","        llm = ChatAnthropic(temperature=0, model_name=\"claude-3-opus-20240229\")\n","        with st.spinner(\"Generating response...\"):\n","            response = llm(input_text)\n","        st.info(\"Generated Response:\")\n","        st.write(response)\n","\n","# Streamlit form for user input\n","with st.form('my_form'):\n","    st.header(\"Enter Text\")\n","    text_input_placeholder = \"Enter your text here...\"\n","    text = st.text_area(\"Input:\", text_input_placeholder)\n","    submit_button = st.form_submit_button(label='Generate Response')\n","\n","# Generate response when the form is submitted\n","if submit_button:\n","    # Use a default placeholder if the user didn't enter any text\n","    text_to_generate = text if text != text_input_placeholder else \"What are the three pieces of advice for learning how to code?\"\n","    generate_response(text_to_generate)"],"metadata":{"id":"OD2JzzqcqtEC"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
